# Fundamentals-of-Programming
# Student Marks Statistics Programs

This repository contains two Java programs to calculate statistics from student marks.

## Files Included

- `MinMaxMarks.java`: Calculates the minimum and maximum marks from user input.
- `MeanVarianceMarks.java`: Calculates the mean and variance of student marks.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java files using:
   ```bash
   javac MinMaxMarks.java
   javac MeanVarianceMarks.java
   ```

2. Run the programs:
   ```bash
   java MinMaxMarks
   java MeanVarianceMarks
   ```

## Input Validation

Both programs ensure marks are between 0 and 30. Decimal values are allowed.
